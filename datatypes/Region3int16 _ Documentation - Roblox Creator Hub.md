Engine Data Type

Region3int16

Represents a Region3 stored as two boundaries as opposed to position and size
components.

Not to be confused with [Region3](/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/Region3), a separate class that fulfills a
different purpose.

The [Region3int16](/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/Region3int16) data type represents a volume in 3D space similar
to an axis-aligned rectangular prism. It uses two [Vector3int16](/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/Vector3int16)
to store the volume's bounds in the Min and Max properties. It is
constructed using Region3int16.new(Min, Max), given the two
[Vector3int16](/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/Vector3int16) bounds. This data type features no functions or
operations.

Calculating Center and Size
---------------------------

This data type differs from [Region3](/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/Region3) in that it stores its bounds
directly, rather than through a center and size combination. Nonetheless, it
is possible to calculate these dimensions using Min and Max:

```
local region = Region3int16.new(Vector3int16.new(0, 0, -3), Vector3int16.new(4, 4, 4))



local size = region.Max - region.Min



local center = (region.Max + region.Min) / 2
```

Conversion to Region3
---------------------

The following function can be used to convert a Region3int16 into a similar
[Region3](/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/Region3). It does this by converting the Min and Max properties,
which are Vector3int16, into [Vector3](/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/Vector3) used with
[Region3.new()](/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/Region3#new).

```
local function Region3int16toRegion3(region16)



return Region3.new(



Vector3.new(region16.Min.X, region16.Min.Y, region16.Min.Z),



Vector3.new(region16.Max.X, region16.Max.Y, region16.Max.Z)



)



end
```
