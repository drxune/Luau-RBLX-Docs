This object serves no purpose other than being an abstract class that
[BlockMesh](/docs/reference/engine/classes/BlockMesh) and [CylinderMesh](/docs/reference/engine/classes/CylinderMesh) inherit from. Note non-character
beveled parts were removed in 2013. Developers looking for beveled edges are
required to use either [UnionOperations](/docs/reference/engine/classes/UnionOperation) or
[MeshParts](/docs/reference/engine/classes/MeshPart).
