Hint

Deprecated

A Hint is an object that creates a small black bar at the very top of the
screen with text.

With the introduction of Roblox's GUI features hints have been deprecated and
[TextLabels](/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel) should be used instead for new work. The
[TextLabel](/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel) object offers a wide range of features for displaying and
customizing text that hints do not.
