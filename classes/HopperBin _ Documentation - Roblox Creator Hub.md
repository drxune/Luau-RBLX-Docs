HopperBins are an outdated system for creating tools that can be used by a
player. In place of HopperBins, please use [Tool](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Tool) instead.

Historically, only HopperBins worked without a 'Handle' [Part](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Part), but this
is no longer the case thanks to the [Tool.RequiresHandle](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Tool#RequiresHandle) property of
Tools.
