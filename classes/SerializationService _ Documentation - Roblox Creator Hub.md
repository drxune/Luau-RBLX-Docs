API Reference

Methods

DeserializeInstancesAsync

Yields

Deserializes a [buffer](/docs/reference/engine/libraries/buffer) containing .rbxm content, returning a
list of [instances](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance).

SerializationService:DeserializeInstancesAsync(buffer:[buffer](/docs/reference/engine/libraries/buffer)):Instances

Parameters

|  |
| --- |
| buffer:[buffer](/docs/reference/engine/libraries/buffer) |

Returns

Instances

Deserializes a [buffer](/docs/reference/engine/libraries/buffer) containing .rbxm content, returning a
list of [instances](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance).

This API can only be called from Studio plugins or Open Cloud Luau
Execution Sessions. If non-creatable instances or services are included in
the content, an error is thrown.

No stability contract is offered for the .rbxm format and the
composition of this data may change at any time. This API will faithfully
parse .rbxm content that was serialized by the Roblox engine, including
.rbxm files generated by Studio or via
[SerializeInstancesAsync()](/docs/reference/engine/classes/SerializationService#SerializeInstancesAsync).

Although it is possible to use this API to deserialize .rbxm content
generated by any other means, this is done at the user's own risk. The
engine may fail to deserialize such content faithfully, or at all.

Code Samples

SerializationService:SerializeInstancesAsync

```
local SerializationService = game:GetService("SerializationService")



local part = Instance.new("Part")



part.Name = "MyPart"



local contentBuffer: buffer = SerializationService:SerializeInstancesAsync({ part })



local instances: { Instance } = SerializationService:DeserializeInstancesAsync(contentBuffer)



print(instances) -- {MyPart}
```

SerializeInstancesAsync

Yields

Serializes a list of [instances](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance) to the .rbxm format,
returning a [buffer](/docs/reference/engine/libraries/buffer) or .rbxm content.

SerializationService:SerializeInstancesAsync(inputInstances:Instances):[buffer](/docs/reference/engine/libraries/buffer)

Parameters

|  |
| --- |
| inputInstances:Instances |

Returns

[buffer](/docs/reference/engine/libraries/buffer)

Serializes a list of [instances](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance) to the .rbxm format,
returning a [buffer](/docs/reference/engine/libraries/buffer) or .rbxm content.

This API can only be called from Studio plugins or Open Cloud Luau
Execution Sessions. If non-creatable instances or services are included in
the list of instances, an error is thrown.

No stability contract is offered for the .rbxm format and the
composition of this data may change at any time. This API will serialize
content according to the serialization behavior of the current engine
version.

Although it is possible for other tools to parse .rbxm content, this is
done at the user's own risk. The engine may still generate .rbxm content
that 3rd-party tools fail to parse faithfully.

Code Samples

SerializationService:SerializeInstancesAsync

```
local SerializationService = game:GetService("SerializationService")



local part = Instance.new("Part")



part.Name = "MyPart"



local contentBuffer: buffer = SerializationService:SerializeInstancesAsync({ part })



local instances: { Instance } = SerializationService:DeserializeInstancesAsync(contentBuffer)



print(instances) -- {MyPart}
```
