Which [Instance](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance) to adorn.

InstanceAdornment.Adornee:[Instance](/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/Instance)

Since adornments are usually parented to some GUI, this property
determines which [Instance](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance) they are adorning. They render in 3D
positioned relative to the "adornee", not to their parent.
