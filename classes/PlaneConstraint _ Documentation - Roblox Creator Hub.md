A PlaneConstraint moves its [Attachment0](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Constraint#Attachment0) and
[Attachment1](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Constraint#Attachment1) into a position/orientation along a
plane whose normal vector is the primary axis of
[Attachment0](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Constraint#Attachment0). Both parent assemblies remain free
to translate and rotate unless otherwise constrained.
