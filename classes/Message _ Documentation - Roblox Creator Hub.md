Message

Deprecated

Fills the entire screen with a semi-transparent grey background, with centered
text in the middle of the screen.

With the introduction of Roblox's GUI features hints have been deprecated and
[TextLabels](/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel) should be used instead for new work. The
[TextLabel](/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel) object offers a wide range of features for displaying and
customizing text that messages do not.
