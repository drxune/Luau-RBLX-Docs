[Frame](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Frame) is a [GuiObject](/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject) that acts as a container for other
[GuiObjects](/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject). You can use it for UI that either displays on a
user's [screen](/docs/ui/on-screen-containers) or on a
[surface](/docs/ui/in-experience-containers) within the experience.

[Frames](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Frame) are ideal containers for responsive layouts such as
[list and flex layouts](/docs/ui/list-flex-layouts), allowing you to
change the size of the frame and dynamically adjust how layout items fit
within it. [Frames](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Frame) are also core [GuiObjects](/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject), so
you can customize properties such as
[BackgroundColor3](/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject#BackgroundColor3),
[Transparency](/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject#Transparency), apply a
[background gradient](/docs/ui/appearance-modifiers#gradient) or
[border](/docs/ui/appearance-modifiers#stroke), and more.
