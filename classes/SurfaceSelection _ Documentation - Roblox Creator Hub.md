A SurfaceSelection highlights a particular face
([TargetSurface](/docs/reference/engine/classes/SurfaceSelection#TargetSurface)) of its
[Adornee](/docs/reference/engine/classes/PartAdornment#Adornee). The highlight's color is configurable
using the [Color3](/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiBase3d#Color3) property.

The SurfaceSelection object is typically used by [Plugin](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Plugin) when the
user is selecting the face of a [BasePart](/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart).
