An IntersectOperation is the result of individual parts that have been
intersected into a single solid model through Studio's solid modeling
Intersect tool, or through [BasePart:IntersectAsync()](/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#IntersectAsync).

See [Solid Modeling](/docs/parts/solid-modeling) to learn more about
Studio's solid modeling tools and methods.
