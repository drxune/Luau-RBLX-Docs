Status

Deprecated

An unfinished object which offers no functionality to developers.

Not Creatable

Status is an unfinished object designed to store custom [Humanoid](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid)
statuses. It has been deprecated and should not be used by developers in new
work.

Developers looking to implement custom [Humanoid](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid) statuses should use
[Character Physics Controllers](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/releasing-character-physics-controllers/2623426),
as they are written in Luau and are easily extendable.
