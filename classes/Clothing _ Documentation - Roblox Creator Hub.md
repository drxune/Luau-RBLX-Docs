Properties

Color3

Read Parallel

Determines the colorization to be applied to the [Clothing](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Clothing) texture.

Clothing.Color3:[Color3](/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/Color3)

This property determines the colorization to be applied to the
[Clothing](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Clothing) texture. The default colorization value is
[Color3.new(1, 1, 1)](/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/Color3) (white), at which no colorization
occurs.

This property is useful for creating outfits that have many different
color variations but share the same basic look, possibly for a character
creator in a roleplaying game or generating a lot of different varied
NPCs.

See also [ShirtGraphic.Color3](/docs/reference/engine/classes/ShirtGraphic#Color3) which determines the colorization to
be applied to the [ShirtGraphic](/docs/reference/engine/classes/ShirtGraphic) texture.
