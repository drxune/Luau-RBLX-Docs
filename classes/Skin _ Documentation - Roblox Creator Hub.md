Historically changed the colors of body parts to match the

This object has been deprecated and superseded by [BodyColors](/docs/reference/engine/classes/BodyColors). The Skin
object does not function on R15 characters and should not be used for new
work. [BodyColors](/docs/reference/engine/classes/BodyColors) functions with R15 characters and allows the colors
of each limb to be set individually.
