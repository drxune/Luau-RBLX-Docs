StandalonePluginScripts is a container of [Scripts](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Script) to be run
in a standalone plugin [DataModel](/docs/reference/engine/classes/DataModel) when Roblox Studio starts (it is not
useful outside the context of plugins). When a place to be edited is loaded in
Roblox Studio, scripts inside this container are not run.
