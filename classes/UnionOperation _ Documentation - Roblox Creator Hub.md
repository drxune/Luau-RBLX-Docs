A UnionOperation is the result of individual parts that have been joined
together into a single solid model through Studio's solid modeling Union
tool, or through [BasePart:UnionAsync()](/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#UnionAsync) or
[BasePart:SubtractAsync()](/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart#SubtractAsync).

See [Solid Modeling](/docs/parts/solid-modeling) to learn more about
Studio's solid modeling tools and methods.
