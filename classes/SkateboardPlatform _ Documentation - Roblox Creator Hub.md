Engine Class

SkateboardPlatform

Deprecated

A SkateboardPlatform can be used to create a skateboard. When characters get
on a skateboard, they are stuck to it until they press the escape key. Until
then, the character uses skateboard animations and travels faster than a
walking character.

The SkateboardPlatform object has been deprecated and is no longer supported
by Roblox. Developers looking to create skateboards or similar vehicles are
advised to program their own systems. Additionally, the [VehicleSeat](/docs/reference/engine/classes/VehicleSeat)
object can be used to quickly create simple vehicles.
