This class was an internal service responsible for handling the now deprecated
[FlagStand](/docs/reference/engine/classes/FlagStand) and [Flag](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Flag) objects.

The [Flag](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Flag) and [FlagStand](/docs/reference/engine/classes/FlagStand) objects were created to allow
developers to make 'Capture the Flag' style games quickly. However they have
been deprecated and developers are advised to design their own systems which
will be more flexible and reliable.
