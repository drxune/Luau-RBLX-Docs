GuiLabel is an abstract class that inherits from [GuiObject](/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject). It is the
base class for [ImageLabel](/docs/reference/engine/classes/ImageLabel) and [TextLabel](/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel). Unlike
[GuiButton](/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiButton), objects of this type will not register click events, but
instead serve as non-interactive labels. It does not implement any further
properties, events or methods.
