AccessoryType

---

AccessoryType is a subset of AssetTypes which are relevant to only
accessories.

To get the AccessoryType of an accessory, see the Type on the accessory's web
page. For example, see
[Yi the Art Teacher - Hair](https://www.roblox.com/catalog/5911063681/Yi-the-Art-Teacher-Hair).

AccessoryTypes are mainly used in the AccessoryBlob of HumanoidDescription,
and to specify the type in Accessory.
