Engine Enum

CurrencyType

Deprecated

Tickets have been removed, so this Enum shouldn't need to be used.

---

The CurrencyType Enum is used with [MarketplaceService](/docs/reference/engine/classes/MarketplaceService) to set the
currency used. As tickets no longer exist on the Roblox platform, this enum is
ignored in most API that previously used it, such as
[PromptPurchase](/docs/reference/engine/classes/MarketplaceService#PromptPurchase).
