Engine Enum

AudioSimulationFidelity

---

This enum, used with [AudioEmitter.SimulationFidelity](/docs/reference/engine/classes/AudioEmitter#SimulationFidelity) and
[AudioListener.SimulationFidelity](/docs/reference/engine/classes/AudioListener#SimulationFidelity), determines how detailed audio
simulation should be.

Items

| Name | Value | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | 0 | No acoustic simulation occurs; only direction and distance are taken into account. |
| Automatic | 1 | The audio engine simulates transmission, diffraction, and reflections at a level of detail suitable to most devices. |
