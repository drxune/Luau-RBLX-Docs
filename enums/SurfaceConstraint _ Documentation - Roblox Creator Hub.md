| Name | Value | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | 0 | No surface constraint. |
| Hinge | 1 | Makes the side appear with a yellow hinge. Any part connected to this hinge will stick to the side and rotate using physics. |
| SteppingMotor | 2 | Functions identically to a motor. It may have functioned differently in the past, but that functionality no longer seems to exist. |
| Motor | 3 | Acts the same as a Hinge, but has a grey ring around it and automatically rotates any part connected to it. |
