Engine Enum

Font

---

The Font enum is used in [TextBox](/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextBox), [TextLabel](/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextLabel),
[TextButton](/docs/reference/engine/classes/TextButton), and similar GUI objects to determine how the element will
render its text.

See also [Font](/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/Font) as a newer alternative to this enum which
encapsulates fonts as a datatype and provides access to more fonts than this
enum allows.
