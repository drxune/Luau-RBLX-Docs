Engine Enum

UserInputState

---

The UserInputState enum describes the state of an input that is currently or
was recently performed. It is used by the [InputObject.UserInputState](/docs/reference/engine/classes/InputObject#UserInputState)
property of the same name, as well as various [UserInputService](/docs/reference/engine/classes/UserInputService) and
[GuiObject](/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject) events.

Depending on the [Enum.UserInputType](/docs/reference/engine/enums/UserInputType), input may follow states differently:

* Simple button and key presses generally follow a simple Begin to End
  flow. Analog gamepad trigger buttons are similar to button presses but will
  use Change as the trigger pressure changes.
* Mouse movement generally follows Begin (mouse-over) to Change (mouse
  movement) to End (mouse-leave).
* Touch input behaves somewhat similarly to mouse movement. Begin and End
  occur when the user starts or ends touching the screen, respectively. The
  same [InputObject](/docs/reference/engine/classes/InputObject) is used for the same touch point.
* Gamepad thumbstick controls will cause Change to occur each frame the
  position changes.

Items

| Name | Value | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Begin | 0 | Occurs when an [InputObject](/docs/reference/engine/classes/InputObject) starts to interact with the experience. For example, a mouse button down, a key down, or when the player begins touching the screen. |
| Change | 1 | Occurs each frame an [InputObject](/docs/reference/engine/classes/InputObject) has already begun interacting with the experience and part of its state is changing. For example, movement of the mouse position, a gamepad thumbstick movement, an analog gamepad trigger button change, or screen touch point change. |
| End | 2 | Occurs when an [InputObject](/docs/reference/engine/classes/InputObject) finishes interacting with the experience. For example, a mouse button up, a key up, or when the player stops touching the screen. |
| Cancel | 3 | A special circumstance state that indicates this input is no longer relevant, particularly with [ContextActionService](/docs/reference/engine/classes/ContextActionService). For example, binding two action-handling functions will cause the first to Cancel if an input was already in-progress when the second was bound. |
| None | 4 | A state that should never be seen in an experience; essentially just marks the end of the enum. |
