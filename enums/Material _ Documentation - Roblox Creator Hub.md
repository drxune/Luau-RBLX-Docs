| Glass | 1568 | Applies to [BasePart](/docs/reference/engine/classes/BasePart) only. Note that refraction of light through this material is not supported on mobile devices due to computational limitations. |
| ForceField | 1584 | Must be used on a [MeshPart](/docs/reference/engine/classes/MeshPart) with UVs laid out to cover much of the 0:1 UV space or more (larger is better). The [MeshPart](/docs/reference/engine/classes/MeshPart) must also have a texture applied to its [TextureID](/docs/reference/engine/classes/MeshPart#TextureID), and that texture image must have a wide value range since the material displays the range from dark/black to light/white values. Obtain [this model](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/15507769146/ForceFieldMesh) for a functional example. |
