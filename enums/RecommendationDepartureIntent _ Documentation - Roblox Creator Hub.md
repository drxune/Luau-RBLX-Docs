Engine Enum

RecommendationDepartureIntent

---

This enum captures the user's intent when leaving a view—whether the
experience was neutral, positive, or negative. While longer views can
sometimes suggest higher engagement, duration alone isn't a reliable signal.
For example, a user might quickly see what they need and immediately teleport
through the item. Even though the view time is short, the swift, purposeful
action indicates a positive departure intent.
