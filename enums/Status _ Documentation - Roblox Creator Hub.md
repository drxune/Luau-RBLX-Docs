Engine Enum

Status

Deprecated

This enum is deprecated as it was only used by deprecated methods and events.
It should not be used in new work.

---

This enum was used with the unfinished [Status](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Status) library which would have
allowed you to add conditions to a [Humanoid](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Humanoid).
