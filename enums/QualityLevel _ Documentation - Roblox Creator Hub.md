QualityLevel

---

Controls the rendering quality of the game. Higher levels correspond to higher
quality graphics.

As QualityLevel increases, Roblox rendering engine increases the rendering
distance, shading quality, apparent geometry and texture resolution, limits on
particles that are being rendered, fidelity of trail effects, post-effect
quality and more. On low quality levels some post effects may be completely
disabled and objects that are far away will not be rendered.

The specific effects of quality level on the individual elements of the scene
or individual rendering features are platform- and device- specific and can
not be relied upon.
